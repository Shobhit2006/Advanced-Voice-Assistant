# Advanced-Voice-Assistant
This is a multipurpose voice assistant. It can send whatsapp messages(make sure your whatsapp web is signed in to use this feature. As of now it only supports indian numbers), send emails, tell you the news,weather forecast, translate texts, keep reminders and a lot more. It also acts as a AI chatbot. As of now it only supports english. <br>
You are supposed to speak only when it prints `Listening...` <br>
You can also run the bot by installing the .exe file from the release <br>
**Note:** This program only runs when it is connected to internet as it uses several apis which require internet access.
